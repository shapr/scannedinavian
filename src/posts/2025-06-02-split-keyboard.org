* Split keyboards?
So you just switched to a split keyboard, you can sort of type again, now what?
What are some improvements you might enjoy?

* Wait, how do I know if it's an improvement?
Try it out!

Whenever I make a change to my keyboard layout, I immediately test it with a typing tutor.

I like [[https://monkeytype.com/][monkeytype]], because I can change the input language to "code python", "code haskell", Swedish, etc.

I've also heard good things about [[https://play.typeracer.com/][TypeRacer]] but haven't tried it myself.

I recommend making it easy to change your layout. Then you can explore, and undo if it's not for you.
* I am not a koala
Koalas have two thumbs, but I do not!

I blew out my left arm for a year and a half after writing code on an IBM Model M for several years of sixteen hours a day.
It started with the dreaded "emacs pinky", aka RSI from using your pinky to press control too much.

After my left arm recovered, I realized if something that hurts, stop doing that thing!

So I bought a [[https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/][Kinesis Advantage]], moved all my modifier keys to the thumb clusters, and haven't had the problem since.

That's my first suggestion, if your split keyboard has thumb keys, that's a good place for alt, ctrl, shift, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard#Description][hyper, super]], and altgr.
* Ergodox EZ and Layers
Layers are a straightforward extension of the idea that holding down shift gets you capital letters instead of lower case letters.

I wore out five Kinesis Advantage keyboards, and years later bought an early [[https://ergodox-ez.com/][ergodox-ez]].

Kinesis keyboards are large, and I got tired of carrying mine back and forth to work. The ergodox-ez was far more portable.

The ergodox had fewer keys than the kinesis, and I'd already bound all my function keys to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface#Design_rules][specific uses]] (email, IRC, time clock, etc).

I came up with two additional "layers" and put my function keys on the second layer in place of the matching numbers. So, holding down the layer-1 key and pressing what would be the number 1 sends the key F1.

Random trivia: Did you know letters can be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_figures][lower case]]?
* ZSA Moonlander
I also bought one of the first few [[https://www.zsa.io/moonlander][Moonlander]] keyboards.

While it was fun configuring my ergodox by editing the C source code of the keymap, the moonlander's ability to edit and share keyboard layouts on the web is great for exploring.

I also found it far easier to carry my moonlander in my backpack because it comes with a decent travel case.

The Moonlander was my first exposure to [[https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap_dance][tap dance]] functionality. The Moonlander web layout editor supports four different inputs, including press and release (tap), press and release twice, press and hold, and tap and then hold.

Check out [[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/QX5qp/latest/0][my Moonlander layout]] or browse many [[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/search][public layouts]] for ideas.
* Layer heuristics
When do you want a layer?

Many of my friends create a custom layer for qwerty input for web games. For example, Angel has a layout with [[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/0LNJQ/latest/0][six layers]] that includes gaming and Italian layers.

I try to put my most commonly used keys on the primary layer, and push
less frequently used keys to deeper layers. I like to have a layer for
media commands like volume controls and skip to the next track. If the
keyboard firmware offers mouse movement keys, I try to fit those into
[[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/QX5qp/b6j67/2][a layer]].

I like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding][Huffman coding]] approach where rarely used keystrokes
require more keypresses.

* Tap Dance heuristics
I haven't used these much, because my primary keyboards have lots of keys compared to the latest fashion.

I recently purchased a [[https://peterlyons.com/problog/2024/05/kipra-keyboard/][kipra]], and now I really do need tap dance!

I expect to follow Angel's approach to compress my Ergodox six key
thumb clusters into fewer keys. Right now I have backspace and left
shift next to each other. If you click on the [[https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/0LNJQ/latest/0][bottom leftmost key]]
you'll see it's backspace when tapped, and left shift when held.
* Some layout changes I've tried
I've been using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout][Dvorak]] for decades. I learned the modern US Dvorak,
but that's not the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout#Original_layout][original Dvorak]] layout. I tried the original number
layout (but not symbols) in their surprising order for a few weeks,
but went back to Modern Dvorak because I just didn't get much
benefit. I later replaced the number key row with [[https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/][Programmer Dvorak]]
and that was pleasant for awhile, but yet again, no real benefit. I
then tried swapping the symbols and numbers on Modern Dvorak, but I
type the numbers more often than symbols (Haskell).

* All of your keyboard suggestions are far too sensible! I want CHAOS!
If your goal is to be able to type with as little hand movement as possible, there's the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataHand][DataHand]], and its [[https://github.com/JesusFreke/lalboard][3d printable clone]].

If you use emacs, try [[https://github.com/shapr/markovkeyboard/][markovkeyboard]]?
* Who bribed you to write this post?
Oh right! This is my first [[/buy-a-blog-post.html][buy a blog post]]
and was funded by [[https://blog.frodux.org/][Chris]].
