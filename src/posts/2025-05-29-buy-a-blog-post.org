* Get paid to do a thing?
I just read this [[https://lobste.rs/s/vdzcfg/two_types_open_source#c_wuhgld][interesting comment]] about getting paid for open source.
I had a [[https://hachyderm.io/@LGUG2Z/114586871580310822][short conversation]] with the author.

That lead to this lovely bit of text:

#+begin_src fundamental
  When purchasing a license subscription, you are optionally encouraged
  to enter your GitHub username; this makes it easier for me to identify
  issues created by users with license subscriptions on the Komorebi
  GitHub repo.
#+end_src

I like the incentive there, pay to get priority.

So here's an experiment. I'll write a list of topics I've been meaning to turn into blog posts, and a price, and you, oh well-funded reader, can bribe me to finish them.

What happens when the money arrives? I'll immediately dump a raw unedited blog post with the description and resources I've already collected, and then clean up the post.

I reserve the right to change prices after writing any of these blog posts. As time passes I may grow more or less interested in a topic.
* What topics?
- [X] A survey of [[https://www.scannedinavian.com/tools-built-on-tree-sitters-concrete-syntax-trees.html][cool tools]] built on top of tree sitter's concrete syntax trees. ( $15 )

This is about a third of the full list, and includes posts I would immediately feel comfortable writing.
* What if I want to bribe you to write about a topic that's not on the list?
I will happily discuss suggestions, send me a message!
* What if I want to pair with you on one of these?
That'll get priority over anything else, I am most productive when working with someone else on a task.
* What If I want credit for bribing you?
Sure? I'm also fine if you want to be anonymous.
* How do you calculate the price of each blog post?
Mostly by how much I want to write each thing. Small price means I want to do it, and think it's easy enough.
Ok, maybe I just made up all the prices anyway.
* Is this for real?
ðŸ¤”
This could also be an excuse to re-organize my scattered lists of ideas, and find people who want to collaborate.

If you want a blog post, send money to my email address at paypal, with a note describing which post, and I'll get right on it!
If your payment is less than the amount in the list above, I will update the post with something like ($5 of $40).
So far latency has averaged 12 hours between request and post online.
* Conclusion
Post your own "blog post stub" list on your own blog, and SEND ME A LINK!
