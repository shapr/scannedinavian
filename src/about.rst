Shae Erisson - For the moment I live in Massachusetts, USA and write Haskell code for my job.

You can contact me on mastodon at https://recurse.social/@shapr/ or find me on the libera IRC network as shapr.

How'd you come up with this domain name?

I was living in Finland in 2001 and I was a Linux penguin who spent all my time on the internet.
So the pun was "Virtual Penguin" or "bird who got scanned into the internet".
Thus, Scanned In Avian!
